        <h2 style="color:blue">His Story</h2>
        <p1>There has always been a distinct social hierarchy among animated dragons. At the top resides various characters from <i>How to Train Your Dragon, Dragon Tales,</i> and anything even remotely related to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. At the very bottom resides Bob. Bob has nothing new to offer.</p1>
        <br>
        <p2>From a very young age, Bob has been plagued with insecurity. Voted as "least likely to succeed" by the high school yearbook committee, Bob has spent the last several centuries looking for purpose. Purpose has not found him. Cut him some slack, guys. Being a dragon is hard.</p2>
        <br>
        <p3>You may be saying to yourself: "Dragons are cool! They can fly, breathe fire, and chow down on their adversaries!" Bob can do exactly none of those things. Tragically, Bob cannot even open his mouth! There is no fire to be found, and eating is all but impossible. These days, he can not even turn on his gas-fire stove without bursting into tears. No amount of counseling seems to mend the inadequacies.</p3>
        <br>
        <p4>What can Bob do? Well, he can do his best. If that is not good enough for you, THEN YOU DO NOT DESERVE BOB. He is strong, independent, and tends to vote for liberal political candidates. His favorite author is Edgar Allen Poe, and he will take his coffee black. He is currently developing an Match.com profile, but it is tough when you have been out of the game for so long. ATTENTION ALL ANIMATED FEMALE DRAGONS: This bachelor is single, and needs a wife ASAP (his mom and dad will not stop bugging him).</p4>
        <br>
        <p5>What does Bob bring to Monster Bash? Pretty much exactly what you would expect, honestly. He can punch, kick, and use his tail to injure adversaries. The power of these moves is exactly average (just like his ACT score). In the off chance that Bob's attacks miss, it is best to pretend like he did a good job nonetheless. Seriously, constructive criticism only. Bob can only afford so much psychiatric attention each month.</p5>
        <br>
        <p6>Health care costs are notoriously high for dragons right now. Obamacare did little to curb the reptile discrimination so pervasive in North American countries. Please support Bob as he attempts to conquer Monster Bash. Donations are currently be accepted on his GoFundMe page.</p6>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:red">Special Moves</h2>
        <p1><b>Tail Flail:</b> Press 'z' twice to activate. Unleases a quick attack behind Bob.</p1>
        <p2><b>Tail Smash:</b> Press down arrow and 'x' to activate. Bob will fall backwards onto his tail, greating injuring enemies behind him. Much slower than the tail flail.</p2>
